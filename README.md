# Welcome to the Stage AI Interview Task

This task is an easy design challenge, to help us get an idea of how you think and work. It is not intended to be an in-depth test of your technical knowledge.

## The Task

The repository contains a template with a single <form> component and multiple input fields. The task is simple - clone/download the repository and provide reasonable styling for the form component the `index.html` file renders.

### Step 1.

Clone/download the repository and open the `index.html` file with your browser.

### Step 2.

Provide design with layout arrangement/typography/vertical rythm to your liking for the page and its form components.

The expected result from this step is image/images visualizing the design proposal to be implemented.

_Note: we are usign [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) framework, which is based on [Material Design](https://material.io/design) - using similar components/concepts is considered an advantage._

### Step 3.

Submitting the form without entering any data will trigger an error. Add appropriate styling for the error message being rendered.

### Step 4 (optional).

Implement the designed layout to the rendered HTML.
